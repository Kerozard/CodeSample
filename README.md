# CodeSample
This is a short code sample extracted from a 2D Space Shooter called Babylon Fleet on which I am currently working. 

The presented code shows the basics of the aura system that I am using to apply buffs and debuffs. Different aura managers, derived from the same base manager class, can be added to varying components of each space ship. Those manager components then handle the various auras added to them over the course of a match.
